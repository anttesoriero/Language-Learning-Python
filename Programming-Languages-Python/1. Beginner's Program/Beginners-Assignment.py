# Write a program that will read two numbers and will compute the sum of those two numbers.
# (If you are working in a functional language, you may write a function that takes two numbers
# as input parameters and returns the sum of the two numbers.)

print("The sum of the two numbers is " + str(
    float(input("What is the first number? ")) +
    float(input("What is the second number? "))))
